# Skole Backend

To start the server locally (development instance):

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate the database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start the server with `mix phx.server`

Now you can use [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) as the API base url.

To run in production, [check the deployment guide](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
